# The Eccomerce Success Equation
The Right Product + The Right Market/Niche + The Right Value Proposition + At The Right Time + The
Right Marketing Channel/s + The Right Marketing Strategy = SUCCESS  
   
Let’s use a simple example of selling lemonade to better understand each of these success equation
elements.   
   
• The Right Product: You need to have a good product. If your lemonade is too sweet, it won’t quench
the thirst of your customers. Too sour and it will also turn customers away. Too warm and blah!
There’s no substitute for a good product. Most importantly, a good product makes your life easier by
helping with word-of-mouth marketing which decreases your expenses and increases your sales.  
  
• The Right Market/Niche: Who do you plan to sell lemonade too? You need to sell your lemonade to
people who like and are interested in lemonade. Think about people who are interested in drinking
lemonade: People who are thirsty, people who have been enjoying the hot outdoor weather and
maybe people who like flavored drinks.  
  
• The Right Value Proposition: Most likely you aren’t the only kid on the block selling lemonade to
thirsty neighbors on a hot day. Your value proposition is what you plan to do differently to stand out
and provide more value than your competitors. Do you sell your lemonade at a better price than the
other kids? Do you offer a higher quality lemonade (hand-squeezed rather than pre-packaged mix)?
Do you offer a selection of flavored lemonades? Do you offer a better experience (maybe you sell
your lemonade in rustic and reusable glass jars rather than poor-quality plastic cups)?  
  
• The Right Time: Selling lemonade in the winter probably isn’t a good strategy, right? Seasonality can
come into play for many products and businesses, but you also need to consider consumer trends
in general. Selling lemonade when the hot new beverage on the market is iced tea also isn’t a great
idea.  
  
• The Right Marketing Channel/s: How will you reach your customers to let them know you’re now
selling some of the best lemonade on the block? Will you set up a big sign and hope people drive
by and see it? Will you start telling your neighbors and rely on them to tell others and spread the
news? Will you go door-to-door and put your flyers in every mailbox on the block? Will you put an
advertisement in your local newspaper that everybody reads?
  
• The Right Marketing Strategy: Choosing your marketing channels is one thing, but using them
correctly is another thing. If no one on your block reads your local newspaper, then that’s probably
not the right marketing channel to use. If everyone checks their mailbox when they come home from
work then maybe putting a flyer in everyone’s mailbox is your best option.
