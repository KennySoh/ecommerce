# The Eccomerce Success Equation
The Right Product + The Right Market/Niche + The Right Value Proposition + At The Right Time + The
Right Marketing Channel/s + The Right Marketing Strategy = SUCCESS  
   
Let’s use a simple example of selling lemonade to better understand each of these success equation
elements.   
   
• The Right Product: You need to have a good product. If your lemonade is too sweet, it won’t quench
the thirst of your customers. Too sour and it will also turn customers away. Too warm and blah!
There’s no substitute for a good product. Most importantly, a good product makes your life easier by
helping with word-of-mouth marketing which decreases your expenses and increases your sales.  
  
• The Right Market/Niche: Who do you plan to sell lemonade too? You need to sell your lemonade to
people who like and are interested in lemonade. Think about people who are interested in drinking
lemonade: People who are thirsty, people who have been enjoying the hot outdoor weather and
maybe people who like flavored drinks.  
  
• The Right Value Proposition: Most likely you aren’t the only kid on the block selling lemonade to
thirsty neighbors on a hot day. Your value proposition is what you plan to do differently to stand out
and provide more value than your competitors. Do you sell your lemonade at a better price than the
other kids? Do you offer a higher quality lemonade (hand-squeezed rather than pre-packaged mix)?
Do you offer a selection of flavored lemonades? Do you offer a better experience (maybe you sell
your lemonade in rustic and reusable glass jars rather than poor-quality plastic cups)?  
  
• The Right Time: Selling lemonade in the winter probably isn’t a good strategy, right? Seasonality can
come into play for many products and businesses, but you also need to consider consumer trends
in general. Selling lemonade when the hot new beverage on the market is iced tea also isn’t a great
idea.  
  
• The Right Marketing Channel/s: How will you reach your customers to let them know you’re now
selling some of the best lemonade on the block? Will you set up a big sign and hope people drive
by and see it? Will you start telling your neighbors and rely on them to tell others and spread the
news? Will you go door-to-door and put your flyers in every mailbox on the block? Will you put an
advertisement in your local newspaper that everybody reads?
  
• The Right Marketing Strategy: Choosing your marketing channels is one thing, but using them
correctly is another thing. If no one on your block reads your local newspaper, then that’s probably
not the right marketing channel to use. If everyone checks their mailbox when they come home from
work then maybe putting a flyer in everyone’s mailbox is your best option.

## Understanding product/market fit
However, we can flip the equation by finding an audience first then learning what products that group needs and then selling products to that group. By starting with an audience and learning more about them (their needs, their wants, and their pain points) we stand a better chance at understanding what products this group requires, and of course, what they will spend money on.

## Start Building an Audience
Ways to Build an Audience  
To build an audience, you’ll generally need to provide some type of value. People will need a reason to be part of your audience. Generally, there are two ways to provide value in an inexpensive way:  
   
- Be a Connector: Help bring them together with other like-minded people that share their interest.  
- Be a Content Curator: Deliver interesting content on their topic of interest.  
  
Below are several ideas that you can use to start building something immediately around a particular niche:  
***
- Start a Blog
- Start a Podcast
- Start an Email Newsletter
- Start a Facebook Group
- Start an Instagram Account
- Start a Twitter Account
- Start a Slack Channel
***

## Email Collection
Here’s how you’re going to build your audience by collecting emails:  
***
1. Select a Niche
2. Create a Landing Page
3. Capture Emails
4. Curate/Deliver Content
***
1. Niche  
So, what’s a niche market? A niche market is a group of individuals who are passionate about a specific interest and are usually a subset of a larger market. Some examples of niche markets include:  
  
Pugs: A niche market of dogs/pets  
Craft Beer: A niche market of alcoholic beverages  
Beard Grooming: A niche market of men’s style/grooming  
Yoga for Expecting Mothers: A niche market of yoga  
Stylish Men’s Messenger Bags: A niche market of men’s fashion  
  
“Join my mailing list to get the best links to the newest styles of men’s messenger bags delivered to your email weekly,” and people will know exactly what they can expect to receive from you.
