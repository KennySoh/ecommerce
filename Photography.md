### Camera Settings
https://woocommerce.com/posts/ecommerce-photography-tips/  
***
- ISO - information butoon
  - ISO refers to your cameraâ€™s sensitivity to light. Most photographers use an ISO between 100 and 1600. The higher the number, the more sensitive it will be and the more light itâ€™ll gather. As the ISO goes up, the photos also get grainier and less crisp.
  - use low ISO, start at 200
- Aperture - top righgt playbutoon
  - The aperture controls the amount of light that passes through the camera lens. It also determines the depth of field of your shot, which is the area of the image that is in focus.
  - Aperture is measured through f-stop, and it ranges from f/1 to f22. 
  - High Aprature f16- f22 , make ur products in full focus
  - Low Aprature, Makes blured background, shallow depth of field. 
- Shutter Speed - scroll buttpn
  -  determines the amount of time your camera sensor is exposed to light. Images will appear motionless at faster shutter speeds, while slower speeds can blur subjects in motion.
  - a low shutter speed â€“ such as 1/13 â€“ is recommended, on tripod

* Your product and collection images can be any size up to 4472 x 4472 px, or 20 megapixels. Product and collection images need to have a file size smaller than 20 MB to be added to Shopify.

High resolution photos look more polished and professional to your customers. For square product images, a size of 2048 x 2048 px usually looks best.

The first image for each product is known as the featured, or main, image. The featured image is shown on collection pages, the cart page, the checkout page, and your home page.
